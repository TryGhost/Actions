    SUPPORT_REQUEST: `Hey @{issue-author} :wave: We ask that you please do not use GitHub for help or support ðŸ˜„. We use GitHub solely for bug-tracking and on-going feature development.

Many questions can be answered by reviewing our [documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/). If you can't find an answer then our [forum](https://forum.ghost.org) is a great place to get community support, plus it helps create a central location for searching problems/solutions.

FYI: Many projects have their own support guidelines and GitHub will highlight them for you as it did here, or the project owners will use issue templates to point you in the right direction. Reading the guidelines or issue templates before opening issues can save you and project maintainers valuable time.`,
