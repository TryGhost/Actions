# Label Actions

A GitHub Action to help the Ghost core team with triaging across our many repositories.

Loosely inspired by [Label Actions](https://github.com/dessant/label-actions) by dessant.

## Develop

1. `git clone` this repo & `cd` into it as usual
2. Run `yarn` to install top-level dependencies.

## Building

- `yarn build` will compile `src/*` and dependencies into `dist/index.js`

## Publishing

Be sure to include `dist/` when committing to GitHub 🙂
